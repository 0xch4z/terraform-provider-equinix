Requirements
------------------
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12+
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.14+ (to build provider plugin)

Using the provider
------------------
**NOTE**: dedicated documentation page will be created in future

The Equinix provider is used to manage Equinix Platform infrastructure using Terraform.

### Provider configuration
Equinix provider requires few basic configuration parameters to operate:
- *API endpoint* - Equinix Platform API base URL
- *client identifier* - used for API endpoint authorization with oAuth client credentials grant
- *client secret* - just as above

Above parameters can be provided in terraform file or as environment variables. Nevertheless, please note that it is not recommended to keep sensitive data in plain text files.

Example provider configuration in `main.tf` file:
```
provider equinix {
  endpoint = "https://api.equinix.com"
  client_id = "someID"
  client_secret = "someSecret"
}
```

Example provider configuration using `environment variables`:
```
export EQUINIX_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.equinix.com"
export EQUINIX_API_CLIENTID=someID
export EQUINIX_API_CLIENTSECRET=someSecret
```

### ECX L2 connection resource
Resource `equinix_ecx_l2_connection` is used to manage layer 2 connections in Equinix Cloud Exchange (ECX) Fabric.

Example usage - non redundant connection:
```
resource "equinix_ecx_l2_connection" "aws_dot1q" {
 name = "tf-single-aws"
 profile_uuid = "2a4f7e27-dff8-4f15-aeda-a11ffe9ccf73"
 speed = 200
 speed_unit = "MB"
 notifications = ["marry@equinix.com", "john@equinix.com"]
 port_uuid = "febc9d80-11e0-4dc8-8eb8-c41b6b378df2"
 vlan_stag = 777
 vlan_ctag = 1000
 seller_region = "us-east-1"
 seller_metro_code = "SV"
 authorization_key = "1234456"
}
```

Example usage - redundant connection:
```
resource "equinix_ecx_l2_connection" "redundant_self" {
  name = "tf-redundant-self"
  profile_uuid = "2a4f7e27-dff8-4f15-aeda-a11ffe9ccf73"
  speed = 50
  speed_unit = "MB"
  notifications = ["john@equinix.com", "marry@equinix.com"]
  port_uuid = "febc9d80-11e0-4dc8-8eb8-c41b6b378df2"
  vlan_stag = 800
  zside_port_uuid = "03a969b5-9cea-486d-ada0-2a4496ed72fb"
  zside_vlan_stag = 1010
  seller_region = "us-east-1"
  seller_metro_code = "SV"
  secondary_connection {
    name = "tf-redundant-self-sec"
    port_uuid = "86872ae5-ca19-452b-8e69-bb1dd5f93bd1"
    vlan_stag = 999
    vlan_ctag = 1000
    zside_port_uuid = "393b2f6e-9c66-4a39-adac-820120555420"
    zside_vlan_stag = 1022
  }
}
```

#### Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported by `equinix_ecx_l2_serviceprofile` resource:

* `private_user_emails` - *(Optional)* an array of users email ids who have permission to access this service profile
* `redundancy_required` - *(Required)* specify if your connections require redundancy. If yes, then users need to create a secondary redundant connection

Building the provider
------------------
1. Clone Equinix Terraform SDK repository

  *Equinix Terraform SDK contains provider source code along with code of required libraries and corresponding tools.*

  **NOTE**: in future, Equinix Go repositories may be released under open source license and moved to Github

   ```
   $ git clone https://oauth2:ACCESS_TOKEN@git.equinix.com/developer-platform/equinix-terraform-sdk.git
   ```

2. Build the provider

   Enter the provider directory and build the provider:
   ```
   $ cd equinix-terraform-sdk/terraform-provider-equinix
   $ make build
   ```

3. Install the provider

  Provider binary can be installed in terraform plugins directory `~/.terraform.d/plugins` by running make with *install* target:
  ```
  $ make install
  ```

Developing the provider
------------------
* use Go programming best practices, *gofmt, go_vet, golint, ineffassign*, etc.
* enter the provider directory
  ```
  $ cd equinix-terraform-sdk/terraform-provider-equinix
  ```
* to build, use make `build` target
  ```
  $ make build
  ```
* to run unit tests, use make `test` target
  ```
  $ make test
  ```
* to run acceptance tests, use make `testacc` target
  ```
  $ make testacc
  ```
  Check "Running acceptance tests" section for more details.
  

Running acceptance tests
------------------
  **NOTE**: acceptance tests create resources on real infrastructure, thus may be subject for costs. In order to run acceptance tests, you must set necessary provider configuration attributes.

  ```
  $ export EQUINIX_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.equinix.com"
  $ export EQUINIX_API_CLIENTID=someID
  $ export EQUINIX_API_CLIENTSECRET=someSecret
  $ make testacc
  ```

### ECX L2 connection acceptance tests
ECX Layer 2 connection acceptance tests use below parameters, that can be set to match with desired tesing environment. If not set, defaults values, **from Sandbox enviroment** are used.

* **TF_ACC_ECX_L2_AWS_SP_ID** - sets UUID of Layer2 service profile for AWS
* **TF_ACC_ECX_L2_AZURE_SP_ID** - sets UUID of Layer2 service profile for Azure 
* **TF_ACC_ECX_PRI_DOT1Q_PORT_ID** - sets UUID of Dot1Q encapsulated port on primary device
* **TF_ACC_ECX_SEC_DOT1Q_PORT_ID** - sets UUID of Dot1Q encapsulated port on secondary device

Example - running tests on Sandbox environment but with defined ports:
```
  $ export EQUINIX_API_ENDPOINT=https://sandboxapi.equinix.com"
  $ export EQUINIX_API_CLIENTID=someID
  $ export EQUINIX_API_CLIENTSECRET=someSecret
  $ export TF_ACC_ECX_PRI_DOT1Q_PORT_ID="6ca3704b-c660-4c6f-9e66-3282f8de787b"
  $ export TF_ACC_ECX_SEC_DOT1Q_PORT_ID="7a80ab13-4e04-455c-82e3-79d962d0c0c3"
  $ make testacc
```
